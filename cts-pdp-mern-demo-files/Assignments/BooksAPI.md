## Assignment Title: Bookify
Building a RESTful API with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB

## Problem Statement:
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to create a robust RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. You will be tasked with building an API for a fictional online bookstore application.

## Scenario:
You have been hired by a startup called "Bookify" to develop the backend API for their online bookstore. Bookify aims to provide a platform for users to browse, search, and purchase books. As a backend developer, your task is to build the RESTful API that will handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing books in the database.

## Assignment Objectives:
1. Implement CRUD operations for managing books.
2. Design and implement RESTful endpoints for:
    - Retrieving all books
    - Retrieving a single book by ISBN
    - Adding a new book
    - Updating an existing book
    - Deleting a book
3. Utilize Mongoose for defining book schema and interacting with MongoDB.
4. Ensure proper error handling and validation of data inputs.
5. For the book schema in MongoDB, consider including the following properties
    - title: A string representing the title of the book.
    - author: A string representing the author(s) of the book.
    - isbn: A string representing the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of the book.
    - description: A string representing the description or summary of the book.
    - price: A number representing the price of the book.
    - publisher: A string representing the publisher of the book.
    - publicationDate: A date representing the publication date of the book.
    - genre: A string representing the genre or category of the book.
    - language: A string representing the language of the book.

## Requirements:
1. Use Node.js and Express.js to build the API server.
2. Utilize Mongoose for data modeling and interaction with MongoDB.
3. Implement validation to ensure that data being saved to the database follows the defined schema.
4. Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
5. Use best practices for RESTful API design.
